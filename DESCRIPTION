Description: Reads the provenance collected by the 'rdtLite' or 'rdt' packages, or 
    other tools providing compatible PROV JSON output, created by the execution of a 
    script or a console session, and provides a human-readable summary identifying 
    the input and output files, the script used (if any), errors and warnings produced, 
    and the environment in which it was executed.  It can also optionally package all the 
    files into a zip file.  The exact format of the JSON created by 'rdtLite' and 'rdt' 
    is described in <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson>.  
    More information about 'rdtLite' and associated tools is available at <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/> and Barbara Lerner, Emery Boose, and Luis Perez (2018),
